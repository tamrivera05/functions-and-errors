# functions-and-errors
A project for ETH + AVAX proof Intermediate Course in Metacrafters

## Description
This project implements a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain with a strong emphasis on error handling. The MyToken contract allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. Additionally, any user can transfer their tokens to another user. The contract includes custom error messages and validations to ensure smooth and secure token operations.

## Getting Started
I used the Remix-Ethereum IDE so all you need to do is clone my repository

## Interacting with the Contract
Use the "Deploy & Run Transactions" section in Remix to interact with the contract
